### üöÄ About The Project

This project was born from a love for classic board games and a passion for modern web development. The goal was to take the timeless fun of Snake and Ladder and reimagine it for the browser, focusing on a clean user interface, smooth animations, and a delightful user experience.

Instead of a static image, this version features a dynamically generated board, interactive elements, and a 3D animated dice, all built from the ground up with fundamental web technologies. It's a demonstration of what can be achieved with just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### ‚ú® Features

  * **Fully Interactive Board**: A beautiful and clear 10x10 game board.
  * **Multiplayer Support**: Play with 2 to 4 players with custom names.
  * **3D Animated Dice**: A realistic dice roll animation for an engaging experience.
  * **Animated Player Movement**: Tokens smoothly animate across the board, with name labels that follow them.
  * **Graphical Snakes & Ladders**: Custom-drawn, visually appealing snakes and ladders that are integrated directly onto the board.
  * **Fully Responsive**: The layout automatically adapts for a great experience on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
  * **Game Controls**: Includes a "Restart" button to quickly begin a new game at any time.
